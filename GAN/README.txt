If you have a GPU, follow this link on CUDA installation for Pytorch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_jBX7OrptI&t=131s. 

Once CUDA is installed type 'python GAN.py' into a command line to run the model.

This script was verified to work using Python 3.12.4 and PyTorch v2.3.1+cu121.

To set up your environment, create a virtual environment and install the packages from requirements.txt.
