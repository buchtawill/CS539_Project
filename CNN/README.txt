How to run the CNN.

You can run the code on a CPU, but it will take a long time and may not be able to run. If you have a GPU follow this link on CUDA installation for Pytorch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_jBX7OrptI&t=131s.

Once CUDA is installed ensure you have the correct packages and their versions installed. Refer to the requirements.txt file. 

Open the files GrayScaleDatasets.py and CNN.py. Run the file in a terminal by using the command python cnn.py. The code will start running and results will be returned eventually.
